This is Google's proto.vim and a simple ftdetect file.

Source: http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/source/browse/trunk/editors/

I'm providing this bundled up as a git repository, for easy use with Pathogen.
I do not plan to keep this file up to date with changes, however, I'll gladly
accept pull requests if Google does change proto.vim and you send it my way.
